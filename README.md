# Classroom-Organiser
An intractable application with a graphical interface that takes a student name, associates it with a colour, and assigns them a random seat in the classroom.


• Seat arrangement is a 9 x 9 grid

• Seat placement is randomised

• Student placement is identified with their name and selected colour

• Colours cannot be used more than once

• White (#FFFFFF) indicates an untaken seat, and cannot be used to place a student
